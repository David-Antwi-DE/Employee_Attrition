Assignment Brief: IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Dataset
Title: Predicting and Mitigating Employee Attrition
Context: You are a Data Analyst at a consulting firm tasked with helping a multinational corporation reduce employee turnover.
________________________________________
Objective
Analyze the IBM HR Analytics dataset to identify attrition drivers, build predictive models, and propose actionable strategies to retain talent.

Tasks
1. Data Exploration & Preprocessing (20%)
•	Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand distributions, missing values, and correlations.
•	Clean the dataset: Handle categorical variables () and redundant columns ().
•	Address class imbalance in the target variable (Attrition).
2. Visualization & Insights (25%)
•	Create visualizations to answer:
o	How does the independent variables relate to attrition?
o	Are there demographic trends (e.g., age, gender) in attrition?
•	Identify the top 3 factors driving attrition using statistical tests or feature importance.
3. Predictive Modelling (30%)
•	Build and compare two classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression vs. Gradient Boosting).
•	Optimize models for recall to minimize missed attrition cases.
•	Evaluate performance using:
o	Confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.
o	Business impact analysis (e.g., cost savings from reducing false negatives).
4. Business Recommendations (25%)
•	Propose 3–5 actionable HR strategies based on your findings (e.g., targeted raises, flexible hours).
•	Estimate potential cost savings (assume replacing an employee costs 6 months of their salary).
•	Discuss ethical considerations (e.g., privacy, bias in Gender or Age predictions).
